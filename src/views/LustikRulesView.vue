    <h1>Lustik game rules</h1>
    <p>Lustik (also known as lustig or sedemka) is a card game originally intended for two or four players. Three players 
        can also play, but in that case, the number of cards is larger for easier gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>The game requires 32 playing cards. These consist of four suits (or symbols) of the following markings: 
        7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace. In a game with three players, four more cards (of all four suits) 
        with the marking 6 (for a total of 36 cards) are added, which serve as blank cards and are only in the game to 
        make the number of cards a multiple of 3 or to ensure that all players have the same number of cards throughout 
        the game.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of the game, only full cards are added up. These are the cards with the markings 10 and ace. Each full 
        card earns 10 points. The special feature of the last trick (last round) is that the player (or pair) who picks up 
        the last pile of cards in the game earns an additional 10 points, even if there are no full cards in it. From this, 
        it follows that the maximum number of points in a single game is 90. The winner is the player (or pair) who has the 
        most points or more points than the opponent.
    </p>
    <p>Another special feature is the card with the marking 7 "zigmar", which is the most powerful card. With this card, 
        you can always take the trick, regardless of the marking of the starting card.
    </p>
    <p>The name lustik comes from the situation when a player holds four (four) cards with the same marking (for example, 
        four queens), which means that they have formed or made a lustik. When it's their turn, they yell "lustik" and the 
        game ends instantly with the win of the player who collected four cards with the same marking and his partner, if 
        they are playing four players in two pairs. If by chance two players make a lustik, the one who goes first wins.
