    <h1>Tarok rules</h1>
    
    <p>The Tarok pack has 54 cards; it is essentially the same as the pack used for Tarock in Austria, 
        and for Taroky in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There are 8 cards in each of the four suits Clubs, 
        Spades, Hearts and Diamonds, plus 22 trumps (taroks). The highest tarok, the Škis (pronounced shkiss), 
        looks rather like a Joker. The second highest trump (XXI) is called the Mond and the lowest trump (I) 
        is called the Pagat. The black suits rank from highest to lowest: King, Queen, Knight, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7. 
        The red suits rank from highest to lowest: King, Queen, Knight, Jack 1, 2, 3, 4.
    </p>
    <p>The taroks all have large roman numerals except for the škis. In the four suits, 
        the king has a crown, the queen is female, the knight rides a horse, and the jack is 
        the other picture card. The numeral cards are identified by counting the spots on them 
        (there is no corner index).
    </p>
    <p>In each hand the declarer is the player who is prepared to undertake the highest contract. 
        This is decided by bidding, so in order to understand the bidding, it is first necessary to know 
        what contracts are possible. The available contracts are listed below in ascending order, with their 
        scores and brief descriptions. Further details of the contracts are given later.
