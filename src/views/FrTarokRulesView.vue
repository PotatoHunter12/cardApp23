    <h1>French tarot rules</h1>

    <p>The deck consists of 78 cards. The four suits are the standard ones of diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs, 
        and each suit contains fourteen cards ranking from high to low:
    </p>
    <p>Roi (king), Dame (queen), Cavalier (knight), Valet (jack), 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p>
    <p>In addition to the four standard suits there is a extra suit of twenty-one atouts (trumps) numbered from 21 
        (high) to 1 (low).
    </p>
    <p>Finally, there is a special card called the excuse, or the fool, marked with a star in the corner.</p>
    <p>Three cards, the 1 of trump (called the petit), the 21 of trump and the excuse are particularly important 
        in the game and are known as bouts ("ends") or sometimes in books as oudlers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>The bids</h3>
    <p>Each player, starting with the player to the dealer's right and continuing counter-clockwise, has just one 
        chance to bid on the hand, or pass. If someone bids, subsequent players have the choice of bidding higher 
        or passing. If all four players pass, the hand is thrown in and the next dealer deals (this happens quite often).
    </p>
    <p>The possible bids, from lowest to highest, are as follows:</p>
    <p><strong>Petite (Small)</strong> - You can use the chien cards to improve your hand (see below) 
        and you then try to take enough card points in tricks to win.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Garde (Guard)</strong> Same as Petite but outranks Petite in bidding.</p>
    <p><strong>Garde sans le chien (Guard without the kitty)</strong> No one looks at the chien, but the card points 
        in it count as part of the taker's tricks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Garde contre le chien (Guard against the kitty)</strong> No one looks at the chien and it is counted as 
        part of the tricks of the opponents of the taker.
    </p>
    <p>The highest bidding player becomes the taker. The remaining three players form a temporary team, trying to 
        prevent the bidder from making enough card points.
    </p>
    <p>In Petite or Garde, the taker turns the six cards of the chien face up for all to see and then takes them into 
        his hand. He then discards face down any six cards which must not include trumps, kings or the excuse. In the 
        (very rare) case that the taker can't obey this rule, he can discard trumps (but never bouts); any trumps 
        discarded must be shown to the other players. The cards discarded by the taker count as part of his tricks.
